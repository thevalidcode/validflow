# ValidFlow: Intelligent File Organization

Welcome to **ValidFlow**, a seamless desktop application engineered to bring order to your digital life! Tired of cluttered download folders or scattered documents? ValidFlow silently works in the background, automatically categorizing and moving your files into designated directories, ensuring your digital workspace remains pristine. It's built for efficiency, designed to make file management effortless and truly hands-free.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get ValidFlow up and running on your local machine, follow these straightforward steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js & npm**: For the frontend and project orchestration. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Python 3.12+**: For the backend services. Get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pipenv**: For Python dependency management. Install with `pip install pipenv`.
- **Rustup**: For Tauri, the desktop framework. Install with `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` (Linux/macOS) or download the installer (Windows) from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd validflow
    ```
3.  **Set up the backend**:
    - Change into the backend directory:
      ```bash
      cd validflow-backend
      ```
    - Install Python dependencies using Pipenv:
      ```bash
      pipenv install
      ```
    - Activate the Pipenv shell:
      ```bash
      pipenv shell
      ```
    - _(You can now return to the root directory for combined development)_
      ```bash
      exit # Exit pipenv shell temporarily if you want to run combined dev from root
      cd ..
      ```
4.  **Set up the frontend**:
    - Change into the frontend directory:
      ```bash
      cd validflow-frontend
      ```
    - Install Node.js dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Build the Rust/Tauri core (this may take a moment):
      ```bash
      npm run tauri build
      ```
    - _(You can now return to the root directory for combined development)_
      ```bash
      cd ..
      ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

Once all dependencies are installed, you can launch ValidFlow with a single command from the root project directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command leverages `concurrently` to start both the Python backend (FastAPI server and file watcher) and the React frontend.

ValidFlow typically monitors your `Downloads` folder by default, automatically moving new files into categorized sub-folders within `~/Documents/ValidFlow` (e.g., `~/Documents/ValidFlow/Images`, `~/Documents/ValidFlow/Documents`). While the current UI is a landing page, the backend is actively classifying and logging file movements. Future updates will introduce a user interface for configuration and to view these logs directly.

## ‚ú® Features

ValidFlow isn't just another file sorter; it's a smart assistant designed to keep your digital space organized effortlessly.

- **Automatic File Categorization**: Intelligently classifies files (images, videos, documents, music, archives, installers, and others) based on MIME types and file extensions.
- **Real-time Folder Monitoring**: Continuously watches your designated download directory (default: `~/Downloads`) for newly created files using `watchdog`.
- **Smart File Movement**: Automatically moves categorized files to a structured destination directory (default: `~/Documents/ValidFlow/{Category}`). Files are only moved if a duplicate doesn't already exist in the target location, preventing unnecessary overwrites.
- **Cross-Platform Desktop Application**: Built with Tauri, providing a native, lightweight, and performant desktop experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Backend API**: A FastAPI backend serves application status and historical file movement logs, paving the way for rich UI features.
- **Internal File Logging**: Maintains a local SQLite database (`file_logs.db`) to record all categorized file movements, including file name, category, and timestamp.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
