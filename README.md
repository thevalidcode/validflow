# ValidFlow: Intelligent File Organization for Desktop

ValidFlow is a robust desktop application designed to streamline your digital workspace. üìÅ It intelligently organizes files, folders, and documents, bringing order and efficiency to your daily workflow. Say goodbye to clutter and hello to a perfectly structured digital environment!

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [LTS version recommended](https://nodejs.org/en)
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.
- **Python**: Version 3.12 (as specified in the `Pipfile`).
- **Pipenv**: Python package installer and dependency manager. Install it globally using `pip install pipenv`.
- **Rust**: For Tauri development. Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up ValidFlow on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/validflow.git # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd validflow
    ```

2.  **Install Root Dependencies**
    This project uses `concurrently` to efficiently manage both the frontend and backend development servers. Install these root-level dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up the Frontend**
    Navigate into the `validflow-frontend` directory and install its specific Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd validflow-frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up the Backend**
    Move into the `validflow-backend` directory and install Python dependencies using Pipenv:
    ```bash
    cd ../validflow-backend
    pipenv install
    ```
    _(A note on the backend build: The `build-backend.py` script uses PyInstaller to compile the `start.py` script into a standalone binary. This binary is then placed in the Tauri `src-tauri/bin` directory as a sidecar. This process is generally handled automatically by Tauri's build command, so you typically won't need to run `build-backend.py` manually during development unless you're specifically updating the sidecar binary.)_

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

To launch ValidFlow locally in development mode, which activates both the frontend and backend services:

1.  **Start the Application**
    From the root directory of your project (`validflow`), execute the main development script:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will concurrently spin up the React frontend (powered by Vite) and the FastAPI backend (served by Uvicorn). Once both are running, the Tauri desktop application will automatically launch and establish a connection to these local services.

Currently, the application presents a foundational React interface and includes a basic `/health` endpoint on the backend to confirm successful service integration. Comprehensive file organization features are planned for future development cycles.

_(Note: Screenshots showcasing the application's functionality are currently in progress and will be added as the user interface matures.)_

## ‚ú® Features

ValidFlow is being developed with a focus on delivering a powerful and seamless file management experience through key features:

- **Cross-Platform Desktop Experience**: Built using Tauri, ensuring native performance, a compact application size, and broad compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Automated File Organization**: Designed to intelligently categorize and move files based on customizable, user-defined rules, significantly reducing digital clutter. (This core functionality is actively under development.)
- **Intuitive User Interface**: A modern and highly responsive frontend, meticulously crafted with React and TypeScript, to provide an effortless and engaging user experience.
- **Robust Backend Service**: A reliable backend, developed with Python's FastAPI, handles all core logic and complex operations, guaranteeing efficient and scalable performance.
- **Optimized Development Workflow**: Leverages cutting-edge tools like Vite for incredibly fast frontend development feedback loops and ESLint for maintaining strict code quality and consistency.
