# ValidFlow

**ValidFlow** is a professional desktop automation tool that helps users intelligently organize and manage local files using customizable rules. It offers a modern UI, smart file classification, and a silent background experience.

## ‚ú® Features

ValidFlow isn't just another file sorter; it's a smart assistant designed to keep your digital space organized effortlessly.

- **Automatic File Categorization**: Intelligently classifies files (images, videos, documents, music, archives, installers, and others) based on MIME types and file extensions.
- **Real-time Folder Monitoring**: Continuously watches your designated download directory (default: `~/Downloads`) for newly created files using `watchdog`.
- **Smart File Movement**: Automatically moves categorized files to a structured destination directory (default: `~/Documents/ValidFlow/{Category}`). Files are only moved if a duplicate doesn't already exist in the target location, preventing unnecessary overwrites.
- **Cross-Platform Desktop Application**: Built with Tauri, providing a native, lightweight, and performant desktop experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Backend API**: A FastAPI backend serves application status and historical file movement logs, paving the way for rich UI features.
- **Internal File Logging**: Maintains a local SQLite database (`file_logs.db`) to record all categorized file movements, including file name, category, and timestamp.
